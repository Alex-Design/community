  * Don't upload illegal files
* **Development Rules**
  * Please post questions and discussions to the correct channels
    * Javascript Conversations belong to the `#js` channel and vice-versa
  * Stick to the channel rules! Read the channel description so you don't get warned even if you just wanted to be funny, use offtopic channels for the fun! :)

  * Behave like an adult
