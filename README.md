  * Don't upload illegal files
* **Development Rules**
  * Please post questions and discussions to the correct channels
    * Frontend Conversations belong to the `#frontend` channel and vice-versa
  * Stick to the channel rules! Read the channel description so you don't get warned even if you just wanted to be funny, use offtopic channels for the fun! :)

  * Please be friendly and don't spam for feedback
  * Behave like an adult
  * Please don't ask everyone for them to code your stuff. The community is about learning and discussion, not about getting your code written by someone else.
